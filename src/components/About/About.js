                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <Section>Hello there! :) My name is Joumana and I was born and raised in Washington, DC. I first became interested in coding around the age of 10 when I built fansites for online games I played. I continued this hobby throughout my teen years, and graduated from university with an IT degree. Recently, I decided to partake in a coding bootcamp to be up to speed on the latest web development practices.</Section>
                    <Section>I graduated from the bootcamp in September 2021 earning my certificate in Full Stack Development. I have built projects using React and React Native, and have learned about Express & MongoDB. I have started tackling my list of project ideas and everyday as Iâ€™m building things, I learn something new, which I find the most enjoyable.</Section>
