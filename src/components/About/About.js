                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Hello there! :) My name is Joumana and I was born and raised in one of the most diverse cities in the world, Washington, DC. I have a great passion for front end development, and I am looking to become a full-time Front End Developer/Engineer.</p>
                        <p>I recently graduated from Nucamp Bootcamp, and have started tackling my list of project ideas. Every day as Iâ€™m building things, I learn something new, which I find the most enjoyable.</p>

                        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                        <p>Interests of mine include bullet journaling, reading fiction, watching Korean variety shows, anime, cooking my cravings, studying foreign languages, playing online games, and random crafting.</p>

                    <h1>Coding Journey</h1>
                    <p>I first became interested in coding at the age of 10 when I played an online game called Neopets. Neopets taught me the basics of HTML & CSS. I started creating fansites for a few games I played and hosted them for free. This was a hobby I enjoyed for years, so I decided to pursue web development in college.</p>
                    <p>My university only offered the very basics of coding courses, and throughout university & after, I was lost on how to learn more. I tried YouTube videos and resources like FreeCodeCamp and Udemy, but it didn't seem like I was progressing much. I worked in IT mainly because that was my major. I still had the desire to be a developer, so when COVID hit, I quit my job due to safety concerns and took this opportunity to become more serious about learning. I joined a coding bootcamp where I learned modern dev tools, such as React. The bootcamp has helped me find the proper path to continue self learning.</p>
